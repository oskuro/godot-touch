# Godot Touch Interface

This is a plugin that aims to make godot easier to use on a tablet. 
Godot has already done the heavy lifting on this by enabling touch and easy way to scale the editor.


I'll try to add to this in a few ways:

1. Hide panels that are not used.
2. Make things bigger and easier to select/tap even when you have butterfingers like me
3. Make margins between windows smaller
4. Visual scripting. Maybe just refer to [Orchastrator](https://github.com/CraterCrash/godot-orchestrator)?
5. ???
6. Profit!
