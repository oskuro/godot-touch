# Godot Touch Interface

This is a plugin that aims to make godot easier to use on a tablet. 
Godot has already done the heavy lifting on this by enabling touch and easy way to scale the editor.


I'll try to add to this in a few ways:
- [x] Hide panels that are not used.
- [ ] Make things bigger and easier to select/tap even when you have butterfingers like me
- [x] Make margins between windows smaller
- [ ] Visual scripting. Maybe just refer to [Orchastrator](https://github.com/CraterCrash/godot-orchestrator)?
- [ ] Add a touch bar at the bottom with recently used assets that you can drag/drop into the scene
- [ ] Add a easy to to add nodes. Its own full screen window perhaps?

Settings that should be applied
- [ ] Single Window Mode = Enabled
- [ ] Save on loss of focus = Enabled
- [ ] Dock Tab Style = Icon Only
- [ ] Spacing Preset = Compact
- [ ] Base Spacing = 2?
- [ ] Maximize Window = Enabled
- [ ] Show Info Gutter = Disabled
